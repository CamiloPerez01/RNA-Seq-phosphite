# RNA-Seq-phosphite
In this section, we describe the methodology and code used to process the RNA-Seq data described in the article by PÃ©rez-Salazar et al., 2025.
The programs used to analyze the data were: FastQC/0.11.2, SOAPnuke/2.1.9, hisat2/2.0.4, samtools/1.9, and Rstudio/2024.04.1+748.
The sequencing method used was the MGI 2x150 platform using a fraction of a Large Mode (FCL) plate.
# Kit used, technique, and labels:
MGIEasy RNA library prep, approximately 350 bp inserts.
mRNA enrichment: NEBNext Poly (A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module
Label set: MGIEasy DNA Adapters-96 (plate) kit.
